   <p><em>Student at <strong>Politecnica de Madrid</strong> Masters in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></em></p>

   <p>I am very energetic, positive and creative person. Living in 4 different countries helped me develop charisma and good communication skills. I enjoy interacting with people and being an active part of a team. Constantly getting out of comfort
     zone made me realise that this is where the progress happens. I look for a company that will challenge me and help me grow.</p>
